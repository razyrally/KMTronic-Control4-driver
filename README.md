# KMTronic-Control4-driver
KMTronic web relay controller Control4 driver

This is the relay box that the driver can control: https://www.kmtronic.com/lan-ethernet-ip-8-channels-web-relay-board.html

The driver that sigma-shop sells for this stopped working in April 2023 and the developer is not supporting it anymore. I decided to write my own version, which allows you to use the KMTronic relay box with the Control4 director. It accepts the basic relay commands and updates the relay status in the controller.

You can download the c4i file and add it to your project - multiple instances can be used if you have a few relay boxes. There is no activation required, just set the parameters and link the relays to your devices.

If you find this useful then a donation is always welcome - my preference is your local stray dog charity :-)
